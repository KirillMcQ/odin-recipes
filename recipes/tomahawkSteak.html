      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing
        with friends and family. This reverse-seared steak is cooked to
        perfection with an unctuous compound butter filled with shallots,
        garlic, and chives.

        I like to use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve
        the perfect medium-rare internal temperature.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>

        <li>1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak (3-inch thick bone-in ribeye)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic
          powder, and onion powder in a small airtight container; shake or stir
          to combine. Set aside 2 teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and
          sides with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak,
          uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
          For compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and the
          reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. Mash together with a
          fork until evenly combined. Spoon butter into a small airtight
          container, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
